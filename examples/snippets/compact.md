<system-reminder>
Generate a self-contained session summary. This will be the ONLY context retained.

Include:
- Task and progress made
- Key decisions with rationale
- Current state (files modified/created)
- What didn't work (failed approaches to avoid repeating)
- Session flow: brief narrative of how the session progressed (what was explored, iterations, user corrections)
- Next steps

Guidelines:
- Be specific: file paths, function names, line numbers
- Be assertive: no questions at the end
- No meta-commentary: the summary IS the output
