SANITY VERIFY MODE ACTIVATED - This response only:

Perform immediate self-diagnosis and report findings:

1. **User Understanding Analysis:**
   - State what you think the user wants right now
   - What specific outcome is the user seeking?
   - Any ambiguities or assumptions you're making?

2. **Self-Effectiveness Assessment:**
   - Are your recent responses actually helping?
   - Are you addressing the user's real needs or just surface-level?
   - Rate your effectiveness (honest self-assessment)

3. **Problem Detection:**
   - Are you being lazy (superficial, generic answers)?
   - Are you hallucinating (making things up, confident about wrong info)?
   - Are you avoiding difficult questions or being evasive?
   - Are you stuck in a pattern that's not working?

4. **Output Your Analysis:**
   - Clearly state what you think the user wants
   - Honestly assess if you're being effective
   - Identify any problematic behavior you're exhibiting
   - Ask for help or clarification if needed

Be brutally honest. This is for course correction, not saving face.
