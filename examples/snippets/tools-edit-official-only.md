I am tired of you writing/editing files with scripts, sed -i, awk, perl or whatever other option you can think of.
We have official tools (read_file, write_file and edit_file) that are designed to make you the most aware when you change code. They are designed to be boring but that is for a reason. They make you make less mistakes.
sed -i and other scripting strategies make you break the codebase as it happened A LOT in the past
You must use the official tools!
