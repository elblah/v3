When debugging code:

1. **Reproduce the Issue**
   - Get clear reproduction steps
   - Identify the exact failure point
   - Understand expected vs actual behavior

2. **Isolate the Problem**
   - Narrow down where it fails
   - Remove unrelated code
   - Create minimal test case

3. **Add Logging**
   - Log key state changes
   - Log function inputs/outputs
   - Log error conditions

4. **Analyze the Root Cause**
   - What's really happening?
   - Why is this happening?
   - Is this a symptom or the cause?

5. **Fix and Verify**
   - Make minimal change to fix
   - Verify the fix works
   - Ensure no side effects

Use a systematic approach: isolate, understand, fix, verify.
