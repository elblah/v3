Take a step back and reconsider the approach:

1. **Question Assumptions**
   - What am I assuming that might be wrong?
   - Are there better ways to solve this?

2. **Simplify**
   - Can I remove complexity?
   - Is there a simpler solution?

3. **Alternative Perspectives**
   - How would someone else solve this?
   - What would I do if I started over?

4. **Verify Requirements**
   - Do I still understand what's needed?
   - Have the requirements changed?

Don't get stuck in one way of thinking. Step back and rethink.
