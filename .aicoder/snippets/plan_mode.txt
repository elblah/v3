When planning code changes, follow this structured approach:

1. **Understand the Goal**
   - What are we trying to achieve?
   - What are the constraints?

2. **Analyze Current State**
   - What exists now?
   - What needs to change?

3. **Design the Solution**
   - High-level architecture
   - Key components
   - Data flow

4. **Implementation Steps**
   - Break into small, testable steps
   - Order dependencies correctly

5. **Verification**
   - How will we test?
   - What defines success?

Always focus on minimal, working solutions.
